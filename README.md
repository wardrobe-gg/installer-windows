# Wardrobe Windows Installer

**Install Wardrobe on Windows.**
A pleasant to use installer for the wardrobe.gg cosmetic service.

## Installation

To install Wardrobe on Windows, download the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/wardrobe-gg/installer-windows/releases/latest), or use the direct download [here](https://wardrobe.gg/downloads/windows).

### Windows Protected My PC

This is a common issue, and many think it's caused by our program being a virus. __This isn't true!__

Windows SmartScreen has "protected" your computer from an unknown program. Our program is listed as unknown as we do not sign the code in our executables.

__Why do we do this?__: For developers to be able to sign their code, they need an EV Code Signing Certificate, which cost anywhere from $300-$700. As a small company, Wardrobe simply cannot afford this cost. As soon as it becomes feasible, though, we'll be sure to get our code signed.

Our installer source code can be found in this repository for independent review. All builds in the releases channel are built directly from the source code in this repository. Feel free to take a look to confirm the code's safety yourself!

__Happy that it's safe?__: To get past this popup, simply click `More info` and then `Run anyway`.
